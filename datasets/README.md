# Datasets

We store the datasets separately from GitHub to reduce the size of the repository.

## How to download the datasets

1. You need an active Python installation with the package gdown. Follow the setup steps in our main [README.md](https://github.com/LimitsOfML4Vuln/ICSE2024/blob/main/README.md) to install this.

2. Download the compressed file from Google Drive 
`gdown 11hRh8YlQFgxxpg1JcLRdnblEFLvXxhpK`

3. Unzip the compressed file in this directory (`datasets`)  
`unzip data.zip`

4. This will extract three different directories for three different datasets: 

* `CodeXGLUE`
* `VulDeePecker`
* `VulnPatchPairs`

5. Ready for usage.
